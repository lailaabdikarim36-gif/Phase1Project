# Aviation Accident Risk Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes aviation accident data to identify accident trends, severity patterns, and potential risk factors. The goal is to support aviation safety stakeholders in understanding historical accident behavior and areas of higher risk.

## Business Understanding
**Stakeholders:**
- Aviation safety regulators
- Aircraft manufacturers
- Airline safety and operations teams

**Business Questions:**
- How have aviation accidents changed over time?
- Which manufacturers are associated with higher accident severity?
- What proportion of accidents are fatal on average?

## Data Understanding and Analysis
**Data Source:**
The dataset contains historical aviation accident records, including manufacturer, accident severity, fatality indicators, and event dates.

**Description of Data:**
Key variables include:
- Accident year
- Aircraft manufacturer
- Severity score
- Fatal accident indicator

**Summary of Analysis:**
The data was cleaned and analyzed using Python (pandas) and visualized using Tableau. Aggregations and averages were used to identify trends and compare risk levels across manufacturers.

## Visualizations
The following visualizations were created and are consistent across the notebook, dashboard, and presentation:
- KPI metrics showing overall accident risk indicators
- Line chart of accidents over time
- Bar chart of average accident severity by manufacturer

## Conclusion
**Key Findings:**
1. Aviation accidents have generally declined over time.
2. A small number of manufacturers show significantly higher average severity.
3. Fatal accidents represent a relatively small proportion of total accidents.

Overall, the analysis highlights long-term safety improvements while identifying areas where targeted risk mitigation may be needed.
